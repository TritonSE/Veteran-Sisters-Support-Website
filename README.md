The frontend is made with Next.js, and the backend is with Node.js using a MongoDB database. Ask engineering manager about access to the Mongo database, and design lead for access to the figma.
Contact Anthony if you have any issues with setup.

## Frontend

Our frontend is in the frontend folder, and uses Next.js
To set up, run npm install in this directory, and then to run: npm run dev.

## Backend

Cd into the backend folder, and run npm install. Then npm start should run the backend. Note - to connect to the database, you need to make a .env file. Copy the .env.sample, and create a new file called .env. Get access to the database, and paste in database url to be able to connect. 

## Linting

Check out this repository for more help on setting up linters: https://github.com/TritonSE/linters. It should work already if you have ran npm install.
